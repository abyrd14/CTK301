<h2 class="p1">Me and the Circus</h2>
<p>I started doing circus arts when I was 7 years old in a circus camp that was hosted by the Gamma Phi Circus at Illinois State University. At this point, I have only ever done gymnastics and year round outside of doing this camp, gymnastics is what I did. When deciding what college I wanted to go to, ISU was one at the top of my list because of the circus organization that was offered and as soon as I stepped foot on campus as a freshmen, I was already 100% committed to the circus. In the past 2 years, I have performed in Teeterboard, Russian Bar, Acro/Jump, Aerial Straps, Tumbling, and Dance. I love to be able to fly in the air and do these crazy tricks in front of 18,000 people in a weekend in Redbird Arena.</p>
