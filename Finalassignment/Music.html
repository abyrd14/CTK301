<h2 class="p1">My Music Journey</h2>
<p>When I was in 6th grade, my mom one an award to have a free guitar lesson with my elementary school's music teacher and she let me use it. Since then, I have also gotten into singing and playing piano and have gotten the opportunity to play at Uncommon Ground in Chicago and even perform for my Aunt's wedding. I have fallen in love with music and learning new things especially on guitar and I have even auditioned to sing the national anthem for the Gamma Phi Circus. I own both an acoustic and electric guitar and I honestly can't say which one I like more but I hope to expand my music collection as I get older.</p>
