<h2 class="p1">My Art Journey</h2>
<p>I started to like drawing when I was younger but never pursued it because I had other things going on as a child. I luckily had the opportunity to take a drawing class my first semester of sophomore year and was able to focus more time to drawing. I dont have much experience in art so for some of the things you see on the side, they are some of my first legit drawings in which I surprised myself with. I like working with pencil the most however I would love to get into more painting type artwork because i've always been envious of people who could create beautiful artworks using paint.</p>
